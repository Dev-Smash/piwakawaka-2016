I did well to actually timebox my week at the start of the week. I had it all mapped out and was ready to go. I though I skimmed the concepts well and had a clear picture of what was ahead - even with what seemed like a daunting 10 hours of codeacademy and 7 hours of freecodecamp.

What I could have done better. I still have this niggling perfectionism in me that needs to be smoothed out a bit more. I could have applied more of the principle Don't Repeat Yourself - especially with codeacademy. I know this applies to not repeating lines of code more than what I'm about to say. Rather than having to completely understand a concept or piece of code, note down what you don't understand and move on to the next exercise. I got better at this towards the end of the sprint which, for me, is ending on the 2nd day after submissions for sprint-4 were due.
