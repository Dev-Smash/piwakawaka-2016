What I did well this week: persevered. Had to grapple with some new concepts like CSS framework. Got stuck a few times, took a breather in the form of short break and then came back to the subject refreshed. This helped a lot.

What I could have done to improve: make even better use of the little bits of downtime. For example, that half hour that can easily slide away by looking at a news website (again) instead of trying a new line of CSS or reading more deeply into a concept. Something to work on next week for sure. I'm getting better at it next week.
