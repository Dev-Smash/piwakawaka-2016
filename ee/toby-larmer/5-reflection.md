I did well to manage to keep on track this week and I didn't let hard-to-grasp tasks slow me down too much. When I say too much, they did slow me down but I didn't let them grind me too a halt in that I couldn't move onto the next task. A good example of this was the chess board exercise from chapter 2 of Eloquent Javascript. I realised I was spending too much time on this exercise so I just dropped it and moved onto the next lesson, knowing to return to the exercise later on.

I could have done more to iterate this week and will work on this next week.
