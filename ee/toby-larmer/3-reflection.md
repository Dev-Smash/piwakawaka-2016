I did well at bringing my attention back to the task at hand this week. I was feeling overwhelmed by all the code available to rebuild my site - and feeling the need to KNOW IT ALL - that I need to take a step back, breathe and make some changes incrementally.

I definitely need to improve on timeboxing and making myself stick to it. Knowing I have made an honest effort, move on!
