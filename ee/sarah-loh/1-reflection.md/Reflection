Reflection is important because it converts your past experiences into lessons that can help you know yourself better and become more efficient with your learning.
This week I did well in setting some time to do my dev academy work and do my tasks one check box at a time rather than getting overwealmed with all the information and work I need to catch up on.
I could improve in working through when I hit a brick wall by taking 5 minutes away rather than hours...I need to set a more regular time to do my dev work and treat it as a higher priority, otherwise I do not find the time to do it.
