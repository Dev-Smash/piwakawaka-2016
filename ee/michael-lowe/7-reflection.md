<h1>Sprint 7 Reflection</h1>

<h2>What did I do well this week?</h2>
<p>
Think I did well at algorithm scripting. I've done a bit of programming before though so am very familiar with some of the concepts required to get through the problems and have seen stuff like recursion in a bit of depth before.
</p>

<h2>What could I have done better?</h2>
<p>
Definitely the quote generator. I didn't invest enough time into learning a bit of jQuery and AJAX to be able to gain some understanding into what I was doing, instead tried to wing it, which didn't work out.
I think from now on I should try to commit to a solid base understanding of things before moving into assignments.
