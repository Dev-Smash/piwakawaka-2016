What did I do well this week?

  I think I got through a good amount of javascript stuff with a good amount of understanding. I like the programming language, and can't wait to get into some tricky challenging code challenges.

What could I do better?

  Maybe if I am a bit shaky on understanding something, would be good to consolidate my learning a bit by watching youtube videos on the topic, or doing other resources to make sure I'm 'getting it'.
