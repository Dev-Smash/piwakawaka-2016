What did I do well this week?

  I think I did the exercises and assignments well this week. Got everything done in a timely fashion. I am finding that I can get into a good flow with this stuff, and solve a lot of it and the time flies by.

What could I have done to improve?

  Probably could have explored some of the debugging topics in more depth. As I know in the coming weeks this will be really useful when things start going wrong and I don't know why.
