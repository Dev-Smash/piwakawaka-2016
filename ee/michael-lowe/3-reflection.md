What did I do well this week?

  I think I did well with using the skeleton framework. I watched a couple of youtube tutorials of a guy that was mocking up a photoshop design in HTML/CSS with skeleton and I think it really helped me grasp some of the things that you are meant to do in your HTML to make skeleton work well for you.

  I also think that this week I used google quite well to solve the answers to my questions. Now I'm getting a better hang of what to search, and where to look for solutions, and also how to apply them effectively.

What could I have improved on?

  Probably could have better understood how to use the skeleton boiler plate better when I was writing my HTML as semantically as possible. I still don't use html tags like <article> etc, which I probably should use at some point as my code with divs upon divs upon divs is getting kind of hard to read.
  I was also not very good at sticking to my timebox in terms of the redesign of my site. Have spent a lot of time fiddling round with things, but I am pretty happy with how things are looking.
  I'm not too happy with the position of my images in my Technical blog 3, as I am scared of floats. They do so many wacky things and I don't like it. Hopefully will get some better control over this in the coming weeks.
