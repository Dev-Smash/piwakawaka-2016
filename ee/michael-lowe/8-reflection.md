<h1> What did I do well this week?</h1>

I think I did the calculator quite well for the first time in this week's content. I hacked it together and I feel like I was quite clever in how I did it, even though my solution was probably overly complicated.

<h1> What could I improve on?</h1>

With refactoring the code, can't be afraid to tear it all down and build it back up.
