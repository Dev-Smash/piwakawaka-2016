What did I do well this week?

  I think that I did well with the assignments this week. Less intimidation factor because we know the structure of the course and what to expect. I thought I did well with my HTML and CSS. Before I knew a little bit about both of these, but the whole boxify thing has really helped me how to structure my CSS better. Before I didn't know where to put divs and sections and the rest, now I know when and why to use them.

What could I have done to improve?

  I think I was wary of not having enough time to do everything so I may have skimped on the concepts a little bit. But I will revisit them as I am completing everything in a timely fashion by time of writing this (Friday night) so hopefully that will help me. I have had the idea in the past that I am more into frontend webdev stuff so I want to be really sharp on my css and html. I feel like sometimes I don't have as much control with putting things on the page where I want them so this can be improved on.
