<h1>Sprint 6: Reflection</h1>
<h2> What did I do well this week? </h2>

<p> I think I did the first minesweeper parts well. I initially constructed the board objects with a loop to go through all the rows and columns. And the stretch goal was to do this, so I thought I had made a good decision to do it that way.
</p>

<h2> What could I improve on?</h2>

<p> I didn't give that much time to putting sounds into my game. I tried something quickly that didn't work, so I moved on to something that I found more interesting. Needed to persevere with some of these stretch goals a little more. </p>
