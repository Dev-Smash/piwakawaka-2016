Why is reflection important?
  I think reflection is important because that way we aren't just doing the assignment and then forgetting about it. When we reflect on these assignments we also see the reasons why we did the assignment, and we can better realise what we got out of the assignment.

What did I do well this week?
  I think I managed my time well, I'm not usually that good at that. I thought I was good at using the terminal and git, and I feel comfortable with them now after not knowing a lot about them. I also think I participated in slack more than I'm usually comfortable with in doing such things. I'm not hugely social online, but its nice to see that there's heaps of help out there if we need it

What could I have done better?
  Probably could have spent more time making my blog look nice and have some functional bits to it if I had more time. Also could have gone more in depth into some of the concepts. I also missed the group check in on Thursday that I was going to attend but I completely forgot about it. Will have to put it in my calendar next time, will make a weekly event or something.
