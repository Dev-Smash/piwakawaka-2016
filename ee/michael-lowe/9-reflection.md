This week I think I did my play with javascript quite well. Even though what I did was quite simple, I feel like some of the things that it involved really reinforced some ideas, concepts and skils.

What could I have done better?

I was hoping to have gotten through some more free code camp and some more codeacademy, but am looking forward to really getting immersed in everything come bootcamp time.
