1. Why is reflection important?

Reflection is important as it enhances learning and allows understanding about things that have gone well and things that perhaps have gone not so well. Learning by reflecting on experience rather than experience in itself.

It also helps with understanding yourself, how your learn, and how to apply past experiences to future ones.



2. What did I do well this week?

I applied myself pretty well this week. I stayed up to date and had a few 'hooray' moments when I had a breakthrough. I asked for help from my cohort and they came through for me. I even helped someone else!


3. What could I have done to improve?

I find it really easy to get side tracked into topics and spend far too long on them. At times this works out great but often not. This is OK if I have the time to play but if not it can be detrimental. So, I really need to be aware of this and control it.
