#8.5 Reflection

**What did I do well this week**

This week I got on with the more difficult challenge early. This allowed me more time later on in the week to read around topics.


**What could I have done to improve**

The funny thing about having got ahead early on in the week was that I then fell behind.
I am actually writing this reflection on Monday. It should have been done last night.

I ear marked Sunday for a full day of work BUT I went out with a friend on Saturday night and embarrassingly drunk too much. That left me a little worse for wear on Sunday for using my brain in an effective way. Lesson, realise that if a weekend day is earmarked for work that makes Saturday night technically a work night and not one to go out getting silly.
