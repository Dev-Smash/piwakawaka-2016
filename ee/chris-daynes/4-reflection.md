#4.5 Reflection

**What did you do well this week?**

I persevered through the programming exercises despite at times feeling totally lost.

**What could I have done to improve?**

This week I spent time going through a book a bought in the past called "The smart way to learn Javascript". Although this was useful it took up a lot of my time and didn't really have great payoffs. I would have been better served by sticking with the assigned exercises and readings.

So from now on I will only read outside of course material when I have finished all the assigned tasks.
