This week was a hard week for me. For some reason I struggled to get my CSS positioning working well. I really wanted to use responsive design principals. Therefore I got frustrated and tired as I stayed up late trying to make it work. On a more positive note, I did get some responsive stuff working and added the pseudo class hover to my menu. I also got images responding to screen size.

I enjoyed the 'SYI' stuff very much and am going to find that aspect over the coming weeks very enjoyable.


I'm not sure what I could have done to improve. I remained positive in spite of my frustrations and got through the weeks work. I didn't quite understand the github aspect of this weeks assignments and after numerous trials have finally asked Joseph to get back to me for help.
