#5.8 Reflection

**What did I do well this week?**

This week and was good at doing at least some week everyday. I feel that I am gaining momentum and forming good work habits dispite being away from home.

I also surprised myself with solving some of the problems by myself.


**What could I have done to improve?**

I am unsure about this one. Not sure that I would improve much this week.
