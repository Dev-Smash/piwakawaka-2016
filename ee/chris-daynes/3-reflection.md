#3.4 Reflection

**What did you I well this week?**

I got thru the material. I coped quite well with using the skeleton framework. I found some time to do some more work around the git repo by using http://www.lynda.com.

**What could I have done to improve?**

I still tend to wander off a bit and this soaks up time. I am going to have to improve on this come bootcamp time. At the moment I am able to do it as I have a reasonable amount of free time.
