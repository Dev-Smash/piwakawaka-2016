#7.5 Reflection


**What did I do well this week?**

I really worked hard this week. I put great effort in. I went over some old topics which was good and this reinforced some stuff that I knew was fading in my brain.


**What could I have done to improve?**

I should have started on the quote generator earlier than I did. I was in Hawkes Bay with relatives for most of the week so time in the early part of the week was difficult. If I had looked at this topic earlier than I did then I would have had more time to research the topic. As it is I still have some files that I want to read through to truly come to an improved understanding.
