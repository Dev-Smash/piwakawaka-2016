#9.3 Reflection


**What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?**

I really applied myself well despite being on the road for a lot of the time.
I persevered. I engaged with the cohort and supervisor on the slack channel often.

**What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?**
I could have used web based resources better. I spent a lot of time looking up how to do things. I feel that I am better if a watch a few you-tube clips and then play around after gaining some insight. Often on beginning a project I had no idea of how to begin, so some insight/walk throughs of similar things helped a lot.

It's the old saying see one, do one, teach one. Or in my case, see one, play, see another one, play some more, then play some more. Then show my son how to do it!
