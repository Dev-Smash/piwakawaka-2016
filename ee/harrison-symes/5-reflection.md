What did I do well this week? After I was down with the flu for the last two week, I did well at catching up. Over two nights I managed to complete the core work of both sprint 5 and 6. aside from minor road bumps, I managed to complete the tasks far faster than I imagined I would, would is especially gratifying as I hadn't done any work for several weeks (especially due to rolling back a cohort), so I was happy with how quickly I was able to pick up programming skills once again. I think this is due to having plenty of experience with plain Java in the past, and javascript (as a similarly object oriented language) almost feels natural to me, like riding a bike. 

Obviously I could have improved by being more punctual with my work, which is a problem that has come up most sprints in my time at eda. I think this is due to the course being correspondence, and I dont feel the pressure to have my work complete before everything else in my life, as it just feels like another thing to do on my computer. I also delayed due to having the flu, and being quite dilerious during my attempts to start work, and decided my work product would be of a higher standard, and that I would retain more of the information if I waited until I was in better health. 
I hope to begin bootcamp in good health, and with less procrastination
