I had an easy time with the excersizes this week, and managed to do them in very small timeboxes. The only task that gave me some difficulty was the quote generator. I started the task late so was unable to do it as a pair, and so it took a while for me to explain API's to myself, and get it working efficiently. I didn't spend time trying to make the website pretty, as I wanted to just get the understanding fo the API and some javascript interactivity from the task, so the website is quite a barebones functional page, with a header, quote box and 2 buttons (for reset and twitter functionality). While this task took some time and understanding for me to work through, I enjoyed the experience of testing, debugging and learning. The other tasks this week were very javascript oriented, and I quite enjoyed working through these, especially the algorithms. Javascripts and object oriented code is the kind of programming that I have a good understanding and affinity for, so it is always nice to work through these tasks after trying to get my head around a different and more personally complex language / function.
