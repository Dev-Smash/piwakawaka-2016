#reflection

1. This week I did a good job of improving my skills. I learned a lot about responsive design and built an extra website for fun so I could practice some new techniques. I still get very confused, but I'm getting better at googling the right things and solving problems.

2. This week my time management was pretty off. I thought it was going good because I did most of the work early in the week, but I burnt myself out so much that I couldn't really do anything for the last few days of the week. I need to balance my days out equally.
