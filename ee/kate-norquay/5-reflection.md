This week went quite well for me. I didn't find the course work too difficult, so I did a bit of extra stuff for fun. I'm doing some of the Free Code Camp challenges and I'm building a website for my mum, and trying to integrate Javascript. I'm happy that I am pushing myself.

This week I could have managed my time better. The tasks didn't take me long, but I still left 3 things to be done on Sunday and then I was too hungover, so here I am doing them on Monday morning. Not a great start to the week, but I'll try to do better next time.
