#reflection

1. I think reflection is important because it helps with memorising the techniques and lessons you learned that week. It also allows you to more accurately figure out your strengths, weakness, what you enjoy and what you don't, so you can figure out what to work on the following week and the goals you want to set for yourself

2. This week I think I handled my time managment and focus pretty well. I got all the tasks done in a reasonable time frame, and I had time to take notes and do all that extra stuff you do when you aren't feeling stressed. I also pushed myself, I tried to figure out problems by myself and go the extra mile to learn more css functionality.

3. This week I could have spent more time working on necessary but kinda boring skills like atom shortcuts. I also want to work on getting up earlier cos before 10am is always a struggle.
