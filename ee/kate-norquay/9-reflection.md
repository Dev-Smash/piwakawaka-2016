Overall I think my nine weeks of prep went very well. I learnt a lot, and I took time to push myself and learn extra stuff. I think I did particuarly well with css, and I really enjoying being able to design things that looked how I wanted them to. This week building my quiz I was super excited to see all my progress. I think to do better I could have made more effort to work more with my classmates, and embrace pair programming as that is a really important part of being a developer. I could have also worked a bit harder on the meditation/ culture part of the course. I didn't see it as super important, but looking back my mental health is often the thing that gets in the way of me doing the type of work I want to be doing. Luckily, I think that both of these things will be easier to work on during the bootcamp when I have set times to work on these things.
