This week was pretty good for me, my mental health was way better and I managed to work solidly on the course work, as well as do lots on a website I am building for my mum, which I want to get finished before bootcamp ideally. I think I did well at writing short functions and planning out my code before I started it. However, I didn't get the calculator fully functioning yet, it works but you can't string equations together. I'm hoping to do a bit of extra work on that this week to see if I can make it better.
