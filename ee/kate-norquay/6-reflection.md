Last week was ok for me. I completed all the work, and I more or less understood what was going on. When I didn't I used problem solving techniques and didn't give up. However, my mood was a bit low and I was finding it hard to get up in the mornings and get excited about the work, which usually I'm really good at. I made sure I had a fun weekend and a bit of a rest, and this week is going much better for me.
