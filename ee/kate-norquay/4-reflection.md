#reflection 4

This week I think I managed my time pretty well, I got all the work done before Friday even though there was a lot more to do than in previous weeks. I think I learned a lot, and I understand Javascript concepts way better than before.

I think I could have spent more time pushing myself this week, I didn't read much Eloquent Javascript, and I didn't start any Javascript side projects to practice my knowledge further, which is something I always like to do. I also didn't practice meditating enough, something to focus on next week!
