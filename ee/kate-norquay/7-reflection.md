This week was pretty hard for me. I wasn't feeling well for most of it, and for the first time this course I had no idea what I was doing with the JQuery quote generator which made me feel bad. I'm planning to do some extra research into jquery this week so I can have another go at it. My time management was all over the place, and I spent a couple of days just watching movies. However I think I did pretty well understanding the algorithm scripting challenges which were fun.
