This week I think i overcame my issues with CSS quite well. I managed to progress with it a bit more and found out more efficient ways of positioning etc.

I could've improved my time management and concentration whilst completing tasks. I found myself getting very easily distracted this week and ended up spending far too much time on tasks, without actually getting that much done.
