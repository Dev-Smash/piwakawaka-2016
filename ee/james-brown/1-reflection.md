Reflection is important as it allows us to look back upon something which we've done and evaluate how successful we think we were.
This week I think I managed my time well ultimately. To begin the week I had a lot of difficulty and to say that I've caught up on the work that I wasn't able to do at the start of the week.
i think I could have spent more time on the resources so that then I wouldn't have had to keep going back through them during each assignment as I had to.
