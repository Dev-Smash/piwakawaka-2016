This week was very interesting as I had to use a lot of trial and error to
figure out the logic for minesweeper. It was fantastic to see it all come
together, although the instructions were a bit unclear sometimes. The Slack
channel and entire cohort really helped with this and I wouldn't have been
able to do it without them!
