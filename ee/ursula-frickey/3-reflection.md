This week was a particularly difficult one as a lot of time was spent cleaning
up the gallery after the exhibtion and simultaneously developing a horrendous
cold. I've mangaged to get aaaalmost on top of things in the last day. It's
been stressful and I've had to take frequent naps just to keep my head focused.

I need to stop going down rabbit holes!!
After really wanting a drop down menu, I started searching for pure css ways to
do it. whyyyyy.

it was incredibly fun to play around with the columns and see what worked and
what didn't, and I'm super looking forward to next week!
