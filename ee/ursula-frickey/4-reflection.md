This week I was much better with time management, even though the work load
increased. It was fascinating to learn JavaScript although sometimes I was
very frustrated at the fact that my code wasn't working (often for a menial detail).

It was incredibly rewarding to finally figure out what it was (albeit some googling
  involved), and then go "shit, I can't believe *that* was it."

  It'll be very interesting to see how much information I can retain from this
  week as it was a very speedy process. I have taken notes and plan on doing
  the courses again as a re-cap soon. Looking forward to implementing some of
  what we have learned this week!
