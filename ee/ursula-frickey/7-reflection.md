This week has been tremendously hard for me time-wise. I've moved out of my flat,
driven to Auckland and then been admitted to hospital for being sick - what a hass.
It was difficult to get the work done, especially as it was the first pairing
exercise and it would have been too difficult to pair with anyone. There was a
lot of back-and-forth but the help that the cohort provided was amazing!

Although I have finished all the exercises a couple of days late, they are done!
On to the next one..
