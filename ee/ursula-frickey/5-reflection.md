This was was easier than I thought it would be, although i definitely got stuck
on a couple of the exercises in eloquent java. They were simple fixtures, or I
had to reconsider my strategy - some googling really helped me to get another
perspective, and afterwords it seemed so obvious.

I did well with my stress levels and time management this week, except I am
still having trouble pushing my git commits for the tech blog due to a
submodule error that I haven't been able to fix. Hopefully should have it fixed
by tonight!

Looking forward to next week, as always!
