This week was more difficult than last week because the workload was shared with
the workload of helping set up an exhibition space and helping organise with that.
There are definitely times where I could have done better and spent more time
on things but I will definitely keep that in mind for next week. The exhibition
will finish on monday so more focus will be on DEV from hereon out.

I would love to spend more time on learning how to format CSS properly and
focus on tidying things (or less on tidying things and more focus on writing
things tidily!)

Super excited for next week. I still need to practice french and meditation,
although reading and learning about emotional intelligence was very helpful.
