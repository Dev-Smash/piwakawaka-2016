REFLECTION 3
===================

What did I do well this week? Geez, this is one of those times when you feel nothing went right. I was drowned on personal commitments this week and I was unable to spend as much time as I wanted on the course. I suppose I did well on the first two days when I tried to learn everything the best way possible and complete two cards a day each. My whole planning process felt really smooth unlike the implementation.

What could I have done to improve? Tough question, I think I could have done a few things better like remember a friend was coming to visit this very week and plan accordingly. I also need to eat better healthier food otherwise my energy levels drop and my health screws up (fact). From now on I can go to the academy to study so I will give that a try to see if it helps with the concentration.
