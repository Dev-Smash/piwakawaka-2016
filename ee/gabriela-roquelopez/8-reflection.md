What did I do well this week?

This week was quite good overall: I'm finishing all assignments on time and I'm really happy with the calculator we made with Katherine. It was a big effort that we made together and we ended up with an even better product than the one they presented as model on the Free Code Camp! (functionality wise, of course). I really like that we can work so well together and I look forward to some more pair programming during bootcamp.
I also think all the extra effort I spent researching many concepts on the beginning of phase 0 is really paying of for me now as we venture deeper into more complicated topics.

What could I have done to improve?

I'm still having problems to complete my blog posts every week. I resent them too much for some reason, it has even grown into this strong emotional response: I just don't want to write anymore!! We have all the pressure that our peers are going to read it, plus also some of my friends already know about the blog and read it every week, more pressure!! I don't know how to fix this, at least not now.
