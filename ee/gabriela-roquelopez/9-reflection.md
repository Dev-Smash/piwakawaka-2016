REFLECTION

What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

I think I tried my best and gave everything I have to learn in the best possible way that works with me. I am naturally really curious and I always want to know how things work in detail. This lead me to spend more time learning concepts that what will probably take other people but I now have some confidence on my knowledge and I feel I made great progress so far.
I enjoy working with Javascript very much and making games. I also try to write nice code, and apply the DRY, YAGNI and KISS as much as possible.
I learned to work on pair programming which was a transformative experience and got me close to an awesome friend as well.
I put effort and studied from EDA as much as possible which led me to meet lots of new people and get into the rhythm from weeks to come. I even tried yoga! (love it!).

What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

I think I did the best I could possibly do with the time that I had. I wish I could have been more organized and perhaps not be working during the first three weeks as I was at the time. That lead me to not be really strong on the HTML and CSS topics which then lead me to fail in an interview. However, all things considered there was not much I could do about that at the time.
