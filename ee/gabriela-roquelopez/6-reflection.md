===================
REFLECTION 6
===================

What a week!!
What did I do well? I think I was quite good programming the Javascript game. Although I had a rocky start because I didn't like to be guessing what I had to do, I believed I picked up from there and I managed to make something that was quite polished by the end. I would like to spend more time on it but unfortunately I have no more time.

What could have done to improve?
I think I have to plan better when I'm going to do my blog posts and don't leave to the last minute. To be honest I don't really like writing these and that's why I leave it until last. I should try get them out of the way earlier from now on so it's not a giant weight on my head during the weekend.
