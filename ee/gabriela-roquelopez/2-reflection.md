===================
REFLECTION 2
===================

Righto, week two it is (or was). Oh yuss!! This was a good week for me, far better than the first I think. For starters I managed to finish all the reports and other boring job stuff so I don't have to spend 90% of my energy from 9 to 5 and then be completely drained at the end of the day. I also applied what I said I would do last week and read all the assignments first to see what would take longer and schedule when to do those. I found I spent good 5 hours the first two days and then I could do smaller stretches of 2 hours on Thursday and Friday. It played to my advantage that I have already read many chapters of the book we had to use this week when I was panicking last week, he he.

On the improvement side of things, I think I didn't spend as much as I should learning to type faster and those things, as I was more worried about doing the Udacity courses for example. I also haven't applied many of the changes I have in mind for the blog yet, thinking maybe I will have more time after next week.

Next week is last week of work!! Then I will be full time student/typing ninja/serial experimenter/(...)/etc!
