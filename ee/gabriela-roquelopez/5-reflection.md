===================
REFLECTION 5
===================

This week was quite good in the sense that I was able to go through the material quite faster compared to last week. I also had the opportunity to do some improvements and other "nice to haves" features to the work that I was doing which is refreshing compared to having to work against the clock.

Next week I would like to spend more of my spare time learning extra concepts like Linux and other important things that I didn't do this week, mainly because I was focused (and stressed) about Summer of Tech.
