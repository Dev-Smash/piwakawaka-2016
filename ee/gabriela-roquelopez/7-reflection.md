REFLECTION 7
===================

What did I do well this week?

I worked together with Katherine this week and we both put a massive effort into making the quote Generator work. We looked beyond the material, found more information and we both came back understanding what we did. Not only that but we also finished it! I also did the cultural blog before the weekend and that meant that I was not dragging it this week.

What could have done to improve?

At this stage I am not sure how can I do to not drag some work into the next week. Last week I put in a lot of hours and still came up short. I cannot cut my free time any more or I will go mad too. Not sure.
