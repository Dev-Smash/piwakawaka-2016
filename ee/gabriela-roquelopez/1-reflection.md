REFLECTION
-------------------------------------------

From what I learned this week, reflection is important to interiorize whatever we learn. If anything, I think this week has been really big on reflection for me.
Because I had so many "panic" moments I had to look deep inside myself to find the strenght to continue. I had to be really aware of why I was doing this and what do I expect to get out of the experience.
For me it goes even further, to make me reconsider many things about my life, my personality and my relationships with people. This week I learned that there is more than one way to experience education, that not knowing exactly what the "teacher" expect of you it's ok because what matters is what you want to do with the assigment.
I did well in the sense that I managed to complete all my work despite being really tired after work. I think it was also a good thing that I tried to keep in touch with everyone in my group and help others if I could.
I can think of many things that if I had known on Monday I would have managed better, however going through the panic phase and rethinking everything again and again was necessary so I could get where I am now. I will try to open and read all the cards first next week so I can get an overview of everything before I start working, this will allow me to not spend so much time on things like reading and give more importance to the practical parts.
I have many thoughts on how to develop a better way to manage the workload, and I will try them out on the upcoming weeks. I also think it will all be easier once I leave my job on 2/9.

The most important thing for me this week was to see how my partner and friends came to my aid and I am so very grateful for that. They are the best of me.
