This week I started out a bit frustrated with CSS,  but through the udacity lessons I found a greater understanding and confidence through using a grid structure and then classes on the rows and columns to assign fonts/margins/padding etc.

My time management has been a bit shit this week.  Didnt get into any time boxing a rabbit holed a bit on the CSS ~ but at the end of the week I feel I learned from it and am not too concerned at this point, but will look to utilise time boxing and general time management better as we proceed.
