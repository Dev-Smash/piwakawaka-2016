This week I feel I worked well time wise.  I took longer than the prescribed time, but as a beginner I took a lot of notes as I went which has helped my understanding.

This is the first week I have felt the frustration start to creep though as minor things (which can be harder to spot) can create errors in your code, and when you dont spot it.  I now realise the importance of mindfulness to coding - though I didn't practise it this week and the frustration took over a couple of times.  I will endeavour to correct this in the coming weeks.  The two are now linked in my mind.
