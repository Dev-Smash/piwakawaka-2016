did well this week:
I'm happy with how my calculator turned out over all and how I overcame some of the issues I ran into

not well:
Rabbit holed on it quite a bit and initially overcomplicated it.  Would "finish" then find something to fix.  Couldve read the outlines better as well as I excitedly bulldozed into the calculator and in fixing it I carried out the "smaller functions" assignment incorrectly and didnt upload a branch as outlined.  Time management couldve been better.
