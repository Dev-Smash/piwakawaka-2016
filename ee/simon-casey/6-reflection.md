I overcomplicated things early on in the sprint.  I suspect I'm expecting things to be harder for me to learn than they are, so I start out looking for complex solutions.  When I stopped doing this this week I got through the assignment well.  I feel I conquered my fear of nested loops this week as I wrote one as part of the auto-generation of the board.  It was quite fun getting a rather demented idea for a version of the game and executing it and it working as planned.  This week really gelled a lot of what we have learned the last couple weeks.
