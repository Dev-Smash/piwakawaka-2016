I think this week I did well in the design and mostly execution of my website - It was satisfying to see it come together as I had envisioned it.  It was a bit tricky figuring out how to incorporate skeleton but a bit of trial and error and good advice (and google) got me through.

I wouldve like to have been better with the timeboxing aspect.  It was fine on the design side but in executing the design I found it very hard to "let go" as I found a rhythm and got right into it.

Also if I was doing it all over again I wouldve read up more on skeletons functions as I missed one that I essentially ended up doing myself and thus wasting a bit of time.
