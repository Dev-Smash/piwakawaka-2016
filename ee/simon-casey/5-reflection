I am feeling quite confident with javascript at the moment, with the exception of nested loops, mainly with where to implement them and to get them working correctly.  I dont think this is anything a little repetition and debugging wont fix.  I quite enjoyed watching the debugger do its thing.  I tested it out on the dot game which was part of the assignments and it was helpful to watch it run through its entire loop step by step.

Emotionally I'm good,  quite enjoyed the SIYS chapter this week,  reaffirming somethings I have long thought but avoided admitting.  Once we can admit these things we can correct them is the hope.

Still finding it a little difficult to get going in the morning but I'm good once I'm going.  I don't see this being an issue once in the pressure cooker of bootcamp.

Also again Ive left a couple things to the last minute which I dont like,  Ive always aimed to have weverything done pre-weekend.  This week our house did come down with the flu on friday, but that could just be an excuse :)
