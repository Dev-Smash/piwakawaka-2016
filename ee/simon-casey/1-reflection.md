Reflection is important as it helps reinforce what you have learned and understand mistakes you may have made and learn from them.

I started a journal on day 1 that I will contnue with throughout the 18 weeks at EDA.  Going back through it is already helping reinforce things I have learned this week and it acts as a constant reminder of my goals and why I am doing this.

This week I think I have quickly picked up concepts I had little to no idea about on Sunday and am now a lot more confident in my ability to learn development than I was 5 days ago.  I have also tried very hard to be open with both the class in the slack channel and assist where I can, and also open with the facilitator in the check in.  This is important to me as the EE part of the course is a good part of the reason I am doing this as my previous jobs have been somewhat isolated and I'm not overtly confident in working in teams.

What I could've done to improve and what I would like to improve is my time management.  Once I'm going I find it relatively eaasy to get into a groove and I am happy with what I achieve in the time spent.  My issue is more with getting started.  I am still adjusting to starting earlier mornings.

I greatly look forward to seeing how all the concepts we learn progress and build in the coming weeks and months.
