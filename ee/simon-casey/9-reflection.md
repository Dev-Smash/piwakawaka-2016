What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0:
I think I have done well in learning the material - I am confident in my ability in the basics atleast in HTML, CSS and JS.  I have tried to be more open etc than I usually have been and asked for help when needed.  I'm an old school google-fu practitioner which has helped me vastly over the last 9 weeks.

What didnt I do well:
I rabbit holed a bit sometimes,  the perfectionist in me struggled a bit with process over product.  My time management could have been a bit better as well.
