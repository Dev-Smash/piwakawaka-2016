What did I do well this week?

I made sure that my work was completed before the weekend since I knew that this weekend was going to be very full on. I also didn't give up on what I was doing even when I really REALLY wanted to because I didn't understand it. I just kept trying until I got a somewhat good result.

What could I have done to improve?

Pretty much everything this week. I was almost impressed with how good I was at procrastinating this week. I put off doing my work because I didn't understand parts and so I couldn't properly relax when I tried because I was stressed and felt guilty for not doing my work.
