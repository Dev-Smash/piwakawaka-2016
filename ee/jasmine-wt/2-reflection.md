What did I do well this week?

Again I was able to do all the tasks and this time I completed them much earlier than last week so I'm very happy about that because now I have a weekend free (other than going to work...) to do what I want to do and not have that thought in the back of my mind screaming that I should be working! That tends to happen to me way too often. I also kept to my word and didn't go out during the week so I could use the weekend for that.

What could I have done to improve?

Probably again time management because even though I did really well this week I still didn't do any work on Monday and less than an hour on Wednesday. If I had used those days I could have YET AGAIN been finished much earlier. So next week I plan to do as much work in the beginning of the week as possible.
