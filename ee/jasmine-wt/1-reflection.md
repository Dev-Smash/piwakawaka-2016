Why is reflection important?

I think for me reflection is important so I can look back at the work I've done and think about what I've done well but also at what I need to improve on. I then have to take these into consideration and make change where needed.

What did I do well this week?

I was able to do all the tasks. When I got stuck instead of freaking out and quitting I just persevered and found the solutions whilst staying clam. I am really proud of this as I didn't know what to expect this week and I am sometimes pretty prone to the whole "freak out and quit" state of mind.

What could I have done to improve?

Time management. I've done much better than usual but I still pulled an all nighter with friends on Wednesday night and then didn't do any work on Thursday so if I hadn't of done this I probably would have finished my work much sooner. However, I still finished my work with time to spare (eg. not starting and finishing on Sunday night) so I 100% did better than usual!
