What did I do well this week?

I really enjoy using JavaScript so this week I found that I didn't procrastinate as much as usual. I also moved all my work stuff into the office at home, pulled in some really loud speakers and just made a fun working environment. This helped heaps in terms of being happy and calm while working.

What could I have done to improve?

I probably should stop listening to music that I know every last word to while I'm working because I end up being more focused on singing/dancing than actually doing work and also 'taking a quick break' shouldn't be 3 hours of playing guitar or watching movies. Either way it was fun though. Really awesome week.
