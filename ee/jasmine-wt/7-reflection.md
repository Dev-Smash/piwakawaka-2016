What did I do well this week?

I did more than getting out of bed!! I even went into EDA for the first time because I knew how behind I was so I figured being in a work environment would help with this. I got a decent chunk of both sprint 6 and 7 done, which I then finished in sprint 8. So I got out of bed, went somewhere and did work. This is a big deal.

What could I have done to improve?

Just staying focused was somewhat hard since I have the attention span of a 5 year old, however I did find that once I was focused I stayed focused for a solid hour or two which is pretty impressive for me! On a non tech note, I take way too long to get ready in the morning before coming to EDA so I end up forgetting to eat and I'm also broke af so I don't eat until I get home. This is dumb, food is good, pack lunch this week! (I am writing this on Tuesday sprint 8 and so far the whole 'pack lunch' thing is failing pretty hard. Low key living off V right now. Hopefully I can get my shit together throughout the rest of the week)
