What did I do well this week?

I honestly can't remember. I did my work well I think. I do remember getting almost all of it done before the weekend which is always my goal.

What could I have done to improve?

Its a shame that my weekend became so insane (friend had a pretty big break down, had to get police involved and didn't sleep for about 3 days) meaning that I didn't get a chance to do the last little bits on time. Then I got strep throat and then I found out I have a ruptured ear drum. So again, this prevented me from doing work. I really should have finished EVERYTHING instead of almost everything before the weekend because this could have been prevented as its the end of sprint 6 right now and I'm doing this. Oh well, next week is going to be a big one...
