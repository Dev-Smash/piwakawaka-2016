# Reflection week 07

## What did I do well this week?

I thought Gaby and I did well at the pairing challenge, considering that it was focused around new ideas (APIs and jQuery) and was in itself a new type of activity.

## What could I have done to improve?

My health and my mindfulness exercises were a disaster.
