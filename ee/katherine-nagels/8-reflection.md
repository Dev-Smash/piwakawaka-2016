# Reflection week 08

## What did I do well this week?

I think I did well working with Gaby on the pairing task, working together to tackle a problem that was really intimidating at first.

## What could I have done to improve?

I could have spent a bit more time on reviewing concepts. I also scaled back my mindfulness exercises in order to be able to focus my energy on more basic self-care activities.
