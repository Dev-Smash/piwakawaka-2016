# Reflection week 04

## What did I do well this week?

Well ... I persevered. Right now I'm not feeling too confident about it all - but I really tried to understand the principles of JavaScript.  

## What could I have done to improve?

Not blame myself too much for feeling dumb!

As always, I could up my meditation. I have realized that I sometimes feel that it's a bit 'self-indulgent' to spend time on and "not real work". But that isn't the best way to look at it, so I should reframe a bit.
