# Reflection week 06

## What did I do well this week?

I worked methodically. Reading the instructions takes you a long way, using the problem solving strategies took me the rest of the way.

## What could I have done to improve?

This week was by far the least amount of time I've spent on any EDA sprint. So, I could have spent more time doing extra resources to help my learning. But sometimes other life stuff gets in the way, as it did this week.
