# Reflection week 01

## What did I do well this week?
I think I've done well on working steadily - doing a bit each day, which helps keep things in my head. I've got the hang of timeboxing/timing on Toggl pretty well now, too.
I've tinkered with things that interest me without going **too** deep. I also handwrote a lot of notes, which is something I've always found very helpful for learning.
Largely, I'm pushing past the discomfort of learning something new and unfamiliar, and chipping away at things even though I sometimes feel intimidated.

## What could I have done to improve?
I'm still a bit in the weeds with CSS, and while I have gotten a really good overview by watching/reading tutorials and following along their exercises, a few more practice exercises may have been helpful. I also haven't implemented much on my website - though that was with the thought that we are remodelling next week.
Ideally, I would put more time into the mindfulness and meditation work - that is a goal for next week.
