# Reflection week 03

## What did I do well this week?

I definitely put in the time, and although it wasn't *too* clustered, I spread things out decently. I learned a LOT!

## What could I have done to improve?

Better timeboxing! I went down the rabbit-hole a bit too much, and could have used a few more breaks to keep my brain a bit fresher. Another thing is to trust my instincts more.

Other than that, my meditations/mindfulness sessions tailed off as the week went on. As last week, it's something to work on.
