## Week 01 Reflection

### Why is reflection important?
Several of the articles on reflection that EDA link to include the quote from John Dewey: "We donâ€™t learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on experience." Reflection is an essential to the learning process because it solidifies everything that came before. It seems to me a matter of information versus knowledge - we can take in a lot of information, but the process of reflection allows us to synthesis that into knowledge, thus truly learning.

### What did I do well this week?
I worked relatively consistently throughout the week, even when I didn't feel like it. Technically, I felt like I was on top of the command line and github material; it feels good to have a degree of confidence in one of the areas of the course.
I gave myself some time off from EDA at the end of the week, and I think that was a good move. Maybe it would have been smarter to push myself a bit and do some extracurricular work and learning, but I feel like it was a good move for me to recharge and - finally - get well! I used the time to knock out some other things that have been preying on my mind, so I feel fresher approaching week 2.

### What could I have done to improve?
I am getting used to the process of timeboxing, and really taking on board the resources that EDA provides on self-care and productivity. That in itself feels like a lot to keep in my head. Maybe the solution is to browse everything, but just pick one or two things to focus on.
I also wish I had been a bit easier on myself. Trying to start a new course through the low energy and fogginess of being sick was really frustrating. Even though the level of the material was fine, I just wasn't processing it very fast and my focus was absolutely shot. I blamed myself at the time for being a bit thick, which wasn't a helpful approach for learning. A better thing would have been to tell myself that this state would pass.
