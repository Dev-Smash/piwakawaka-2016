# Reflection week 01

## Why is reflection important?
Many of the links and resources on reflection given by EDA mention a quote by John Dewey: “We don’t learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on experience.” In other words, it's reflection that allows us to solidify the learning process. I see it as the difference between information and knowledge: one can learn a whole lot of data, but it's through reflection that it is distilled into knowledge.

## What did I do well this week?
I worked quite consistently on the weekdays, even when I didn't feel like it. On the technical side, I am quite comfortable with git/hub and the command line - it feels good to have a bit of confidence with some of the material.
I took some time completely off EDA at the end of the week, which I think was a good decision. Maybe I should have spent that time doing extracurricular/improving activities, but I was able to - finally - get well and also knock out some tasks which have been distracting me. I feel recharged heading into EDA week 02. Although I know it's better to do a bit everyday rather than do everything in 2 or 3 days, I think having one full day off EDA a week might be a good strategy for me.

## What could I have done to improve?
I am still getting my head around timeboxing and leveraging the self-care and productivity resources that EDA recommend. It feels like a lot to take on - I think I'm going to check all the resources and pick a couple of things to focus on each week.
Starting a course like this with the low energy and brain-fogginess of being sick was difficult. I got really frustrated at myself - although the level of the material is fine, I just wasn't processing things as fast as usual. So, outside of not being sick, a better strategy would have been to be a bit more gentle and less blaming/panicky to myself.
