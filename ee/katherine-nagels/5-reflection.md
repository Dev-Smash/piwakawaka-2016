# Reflection week 05

## What did I do well this week?

I pushed myself. This was a much smaller week than last, so I spent quite a bit of extra time on 'stretch' tasks - this really helped my learning.

## What could I have done to improve?

Dealing better with the frustration of not knowing things - I guess this is where mindfulness techniques come in. I will say that I improved my problem solving skills, but sometimes it is difficult emotionally. Everything you read about learning to code says "it's hard, you will feel stupid, just keep at it and you'll get there". Still, sometimes I just felt like the dumbest person in the world. So not only do I need to improve my skills, I need to improve how I feel about that process.
