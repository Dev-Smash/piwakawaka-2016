What did I do well this week?
Not too much really..

 What could I have done to improve?
I needed to spend waaaay more time on my work, I had a bit of trouble trying to get my nav bars all sorted my top and bottom, now that all my links are working I'm not sure how to get the banner across, I have a lot of incomplete things on my webpage that need fixing, but its absolutely time consuming when your just writing random codes seeing which one does the right job. I feel like I'm forever trying to fix stuff on my webpage that I haven't spent enough time doing my waffle cards work.
