**What did i do well this week?**
I was pretty lost this week, creating a calculator from scratch was quite hard for me, I broke the rules and had a look at how other calculators were structured because I had non clue what I was doing, it was really hard doing it alone too, I reckon it would have been much easier working with a pair!
**What could I have done to improve?**
Watch more youtube videos about javascript etc! To keep filling my head up with this new language and familiarize myself with it more and more.
