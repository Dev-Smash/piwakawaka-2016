**What did I do well this week?**
Was a pretty good week for me easier than last week thats for sure, Ive been enjoying all my work so far besides the 10+ hour codeacademy exercises. Im never too sure what I do well, as long as Im getting the work done.

 **What could I have done to improve?**
 Not too sure but a lot i guess, theres always room for improvement in all areas.
