**What did i do well this week?**
    I finally managed to fix some of the problems I was facing at the beggining
    of the week.
    Even though Im behind I'm catching up as fast as I can. Im really enjoying
    working with css making my blog page look pretty but its is a pain when you
    cant change what you want, and time flies by so quickly.


**What could I have done to improve?**
    A lot! I could have spent more time doing more work every night, sometimes i
    feel super tired because I have to work around my babys schedule and that
    leaves me working till ungodly hours of the morning and not getting much
    sleep to get up in the morning to sort him for kohanga. But ill manage a
    better routine soon!
