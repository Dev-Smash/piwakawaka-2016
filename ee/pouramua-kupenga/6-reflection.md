**What did I do well this week?**
Im not too sure, I guess, I really struggled with this week, I didn't get much time to spend on my game and competely learn the bits and bobs I need. I spent a lot of time on google and I had to rush through it a little bit to get onto the next task, because I'm behind as always, I guess I dont manage my time well enough and sometimes life happens and things come up and a lot of things have come up for me this week, with holidays and being back in my hometown.

**What could I have done to improve?**
A LOT! Spend more time on mastering my tools, e.g. how to work javascript properly!
