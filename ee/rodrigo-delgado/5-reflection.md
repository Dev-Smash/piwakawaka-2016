Week 5:

What did I do well this week?

I think that this week has been really good, definitely better than last week.
The assignments didnâ€™t take me too long to complete. I was watching tutorials and
reading about JS so now I understand it better.


What could I have done to improve?

I would like to spend more time doing JS exercises so then I can go into more depth.
Also I was researching about Jquery and I think it will be a really interesting
JS library to learn, I might have a proper look into it.
