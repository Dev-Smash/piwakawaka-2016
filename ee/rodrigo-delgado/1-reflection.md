Reflections

In any role or situation reflection is an important part of learning.
Reflections help us to improve our skills by questioning everyday, in a positive way, what are you doing and why are you doing it.
Then we can decide whether there is a better way to do it in the further.

This week I have learnt more than I expected.  Some of the material is familiar but not all of it. I am putting a lot of hours and effort to reach my full potential.
I was stuck on a really simple task that I could not fix because I was completely blocked.
I have realised it is really important to have brakes and ask people on the channel as they are willing to help.
