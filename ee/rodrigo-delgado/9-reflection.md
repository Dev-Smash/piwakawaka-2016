**What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?**


* During these 9 weeks I’ve learnt a lot. I can’t believe all the stuff I learnt in this short period of time. I think that I did really well managing my time and focusing on the material even though I was working full time for the first 8 weeks.
* I started this course with no knowledge on coding. I knew some stuff of HTML and CSS but not even the basics. I can now say that I’m confident in HTML, CSS, Command line, Git and some JavaScript.
I think that training my mind every day, using good habits and discipline helped me so much on focusing and understanding this new world of technology.  


**What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0**

* To improve I should have quit my job earlier and dedicated more time to studying and coding. I think doing both isn’t a good thing as I got too stressed and sometimes struggled to digest the information
