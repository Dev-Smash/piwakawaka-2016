This week has been the longest week ever... I was so busy at work that I couldnâ€™t find much time off to finish my assessments.  JavaScript is hard! It's so much information that I can't learn in few days or even weeks.

I am taken some time off work so then I can dedicate more time to study. I hope that next week will be better than this week :D.
