Why is reflection important?

Reflection is the key to truly learning. By reflecting on what we've covered over the past week, we're not only able to learn from our mistakes (and our successes!), but we're actively moving that knowledge from our short-term memory to our long-term memory. Reflection teaches us a lot about the way we learn and gives us a different perspective.

What did I do well this week?

This week I think I managed my time relatively well, especially since I had no idea what to expect or how long it would take me to do certain tasks.

What could I have done to improve?

I think my strategy for week two will be to read through the assignments in full so I know exactly what's required of me before I begin, and I'll also spend a bit more time on the resources. I think I might've jumped in on a couple of tasks before I was truly ready and I could've done better to try and really understand the subject matter, rather than settling for just knowing enough to get the job done.
