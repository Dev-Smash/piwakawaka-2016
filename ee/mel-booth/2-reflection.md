What did I do well this week?

This week went pretty well for me - almost too well, to the point where I started questioning whether I was doing things right because they didn't seem to be taking as long as I thought they should! I took note of last week's reflection and this time before diving right in I skimmed over all the assignments first to see what I needed to know and how they related to each other, then I spent more time looking over the resources before completing the tasks - perhaps that's why things came a bit easier this week.

What could I have done to improve?

I'd still like to spend more time practicing/reiterating certain things - particularly CSS. I've become stuck a couple of times this week on CSS and even though I've eventually fixed all the problems I had (thanks Google!) the issue itself has still confused me, so I think I need to spend more time figuring out 'why' certain things worked, rather than just fixing them, sighing with relief and moving on.
