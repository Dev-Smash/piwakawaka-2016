What did I do well this week?

This week was tough, sickness all round, support network away, very limited time to focus and get my work done. I think I did particularly well at not giving up on understanding the Skeleton framework - it really threw me, and I considered throwing in the towel and doing things my own way MANY times, but I figured I'd be disappointed in myself if I got to the end of the week knowing I could've tried harder. So I kept at it, even though I felt like I was wasting hours at a time, reading the same material over and over again. But I got there in the end and I feel bloody good for it.

What could I have done to improve?

I think I did pretty well considering, but if I'm faced with another tough week like this in the future, I think I need to be nicer to myself (and those around me) and stress less. Sickness happens, work happens, life happens. There's always tomorrow - or the next day or the next day...
