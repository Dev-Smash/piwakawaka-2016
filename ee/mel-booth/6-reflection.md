What did I do well this week?

I think this week I did well to reign myself back in when I started feeling like I didn't know what the hell I was doing. As soon as I started the Minesweeper assignment I was instantly confused and overwhelmed. I kept feeling like I'd missed something, and that everything I'd learnt over the past few weeks hadn't sunk in at all. The useless feeling was compounded by the lack of time I've had this week to sit down and really focus. So I think I did well to calm myself down, and probably upgraded myself to Google-pro status after all the lengthy Google sessions I had just trying to remember how to write functions and what syntax goes where...

What could I have done to improve?

I think due to time constraints, I began by rushing through everything and panicking as soon as I couldn't figure things out. I could've slowed down, and perhaps focused on doing some revision from previous week's exercises to get my head back in the game.
