What did I do well this week?
This week I muddled through a bit. I finished the material and didn't let the stress of not actually knowing what the fuck I was doing get to me.

What could I have done to improve?
I could have tried harder to understand what I was actually doing, but because I didn't have a lot of spare time, instead of pulling a problem apart and trying to piece it back together, whenever I didn't understand, I jumped straight for goole to get the answer. Sometimes the answer made sense, other times it didn't. Sometimes I tried to understand the answer, other times I didn't. I feel like even though I learnt a lot this week - there are some massive holes in my knowledge and they're probably going to come back to bite me in the ass in the coming weeks...
