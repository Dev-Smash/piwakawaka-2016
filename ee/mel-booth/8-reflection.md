What did I do well this week?

I handled some personal stressors well this week - instead of flipping out, I soldiered on. Also, I managed a bit of revision which was quite nice because it showed me how much I've learned and which areas I probably need to work on.

What could I have done to improve?

I feel like I did the bare minimum this week when it came to the assignments. Partly because of work, a sick kid and some general stressful situations that distracted me a little, so I lost my focus a bit. Heading in to the last week of Phase 0, I think I need to reign in my focus a bit, do some more revision of what we've worked on over the last 8 weeks and not attempt to work from the couch while someone else watches Frozen (for the 67th time) because my neck aches like a mofo.
