What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

I think I did a lot of great things, but mainly throughout the entire 9 weeks, I've managed to complete all assignments and tasks on time - no delays, no excuses - before Sunday rolled around every week, everything was done. I always slept well on Sunday night! I'm incredibly proud of myself for managing a full time job, a toddler and part time study over the last 9 weeks. It was a challenge but I fucking love a challenge.

What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

I don't think there's a lot that I could've, or would've done differently. Maybe I would've liked to 'do more' overall, but when I look back at the last few weeks, I think I did pretty bloody well to do as much as I did in the time that I had.
