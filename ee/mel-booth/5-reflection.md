What did I do well this week?

I found this week a breeze compared to last week's information overload. I think I managed my time well which meant I was able to relax a bit this weekend and spend some quality time with my family. I also managed to fit in some exercise and a couple of mindfulness sessions, which was a big improvement on last week.

What could I have done to improve?

I'm pretty happy with this week, but I could've done a bit of JS study to cement what we've been learning. In saying that, I really appreciated having some family time and some me time - two things which I think are really important to keep stress levels low and remind yourself why you're making such a massive career change in the first place. So I wouldn't change anything!
