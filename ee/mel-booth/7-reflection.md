What did I do well this week?

I implemented the Siberian North Railroad technique quite a bit this week in order not to fly off the rails (or railroad).


What could I have done to improve?

This week, I could've done better with my attempts to write the code before digging up the solution. I think I'm too quick to give up. I often find myself quickly frustrated so I look up the solution to a problem, only to find that it was a lot simpler than I anticipated, and if I'd just given it a proper crack and spent more time on it, I probably could've solved it, or at least come very close. I think the reason I've done this is because my study environment hasn't been the best - especially this week. It's easy to get frustrated and give up when you can't concentrate because of various distractions in the background - and it's a task in itself not scream at said distractions and piss off everyone around you...
